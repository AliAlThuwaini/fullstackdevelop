Steps to create a todo item directly from the webpage:
======================================================
1- in the view (index.html) 
    1- created a form with a text input in order to enter the todo name in it.
    2- set the action= to a certain route. In our case: action='/todos/create'
- in the controller (app.py):
    1- create a listner and set it to listen to the same route in the action value in step# 1.2 above
    2- create a method controller to:
        1- grap the form input (name of the new todo item)
        2- prepare it to be inserted to the db by making that input as an object of Todo class
        3- db.session.add to add it to the pending stage just before actually push it to db
        4- commit to do the actual change in the db: db.session.commit()
        5- Finally, redirect to our index route to get a fresh grap of todos table records and display it to customer.
