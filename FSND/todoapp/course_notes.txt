Steps to create a todo item directly from the webpage:
======================================================
1- in the view (index.html) 
    1- created a form with a text input in order to enter the todo name in it.
    2- set the action= to a certain route. In our case: action='/todos/create'
- in the controller (app.py):
    1- create a listner and set it to listen to the same route in the action value in step# 1.2 above
    2- create a method controller to:
        1- grap the form input (name of the new todo item)
        2- prepare it to be inserted to the db by making that input as an object of Todo class
        3- db.session.add to add it to the pending stage just before actually push it to db
        4- commit to do the actual change in the db: db.session.commit()
        5- Finally, redirect to our index route to get a fresh grap of todos table records and display it to customer.


Using Ajax to send data to flask:
=================================
- Reminder, there are 3 ways to get data into flask:
    1- URL query parameters: Example:
        URL parameters: /foo?field1=valu1
        grap input in flask: value1 = request.args.get('field1')
    2- Form input: Example:
        flask grapping the input: 
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')
    3- Json data type:
        request: application/json
        flask grapping: 
        data_string = request.data
        data_dictionary = json.loads(data_string)

- Two ways to send data to flask:
    - synchronously: like the html form
    - asynchronously: data sent from client to server and then back to client without client ever need to be refreshed

- Methods to send Ajax request:
    - XMLHttpRequest
    - Fetch: more modern implementation that former one.

- Why to use Ajax for creating a todo item? Because it is asynchronous and wont need a page refresh to get the item included

- Steps to use Ajax to create the todo item:
    1- Send POST request over
    2- Amend your controler function in the app.py (create_todo()) to receive the request as json and send the response back to the client as json object as well. No redirect anymore!
    3- Get the reponse back (first .then functioon )
    4- Parse response as json (second .then function)
    5- Use that json response to append that item as a child (thrid .then function)


Handling errors in the controller function and prevend accedintal db commit when connection closed
=====================================================================================================
(try except finally) block was added to the create_todo() function in the route: '/todos/create'. Reason: if something went wrong and the app closed the connection to db, there is an implicit commit here and hence, we may accidently commit something undesirable to db. In order to prevent that, we added the (try except finally) to prevent such mistakes.



DB Migrations:
===============

$ flask db migrate 	
Creates a migration script template to fill out

$ flask db upgrade
apply unapplied migrations

$ flask db downgrade
rollback applied migrations

in flask, 
    - Flask-Migrate (flask-migrate) is our migration manager for migrating SQLAlchemy-based database changes. underneath, it uses Alembic library.
    - Flask-Script (flask-script) let us run migration scripts we defined, from terminal
    - Read flask-migrate docs here: https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Steps to get migrations going:
    1- Initialize the migration repository structure for storing migrations (This is done only once for the project in order to create the folder migrations and its content in wich migration scripts will be stored)
        $ flask db init
    2- Create a migration script (using Flask-Migrate)
        $ flask db migrate
        this detects the model changes to be made, and creates a migration file with upgrade and downgrade logic setup
    3- Run the upgrade command to apply the unapplied migrations:
        $ flask db upgrade
    4- Once point#3 is executed, the following will exist:
        4.1- the changes will exist in our db. In our case a new table called todos was added to todoapp db
        4.2- Another table named 'alembic_version' is also added to todoapp. Purpose: it stores the versions of our db. this is used internally by flask-migrate and we should not touch
    3-(Manually) Run the migration script (using Flask-Script)




Update item in DB:
===================

Using sql:
----------
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Using SQLAlchemy:
-----------------
user = User.query.get(some_id)
user.name = 'Some new name'
db.session.commit()



Jinja templates doc, review statements:
http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#if



Delete item from DB:
===================

Using sql:
----------
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Using SQLAlchemy ORM:
----------------------
todo = Todo.query.get(todo_id) 
db.session.delete(todo) # or...
Todo.query.filter_by(id=todo_id).delete()
db.session.commit()



Database Relationships:
========================
- If we've a driver table and a vehicle table, we can see that one driver may own/drive multiple vehicles. 
- Foregin key is always stored in child table (vehicle table in this case) and resembles the primary key on parent table.
- in SQLAlchemy, Relationships are offered utilizing: db.relationship interface (where db is SQLAlchemy instance)
  Note: db.relationship is specified in the parent table:

    class somePARENT(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable= False)
        children = db.relationship('someChildModelName', backref= 'some_parent')

- we need to mind when to do/load joins. Waiting time becomes noticeable when it is 150 ms (milliseconds). Therefore, we need to be careful not to affect user experience!
- When calling child1.some_parent, SQLAlchemy determines when we load the parent from the database.
- Two types of loading child1.some_parent:
    1- Lazy Loading:
        load only when needed. i.e. when the child1.some_parent get called, then we load joined data. This is the default in SQLAlchemy. Pros: no initial time waiting. Cons: produces a join SQL every time there is a request for a joined asset.
    2- Eager Loading:
        Load all data in one expensive joined operation all at once. Pros: reduces furhter queries as they will ready from existing data. Cons: Long upfront waiting initial waiting time.
    There are two popular configuration types: lazy=True -> this is the default and no need ot explicitly mention it, lazy='joned'  OR lazy='select' -> eager:
    children = db.relationship('someChildModelName', backref= 'some_parent', lazy='joined)
    Check resources on loading types: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/loading_relationships.html

- Beside loading type, there are two useful features:

    class PARENT(db.Model):
        _tablename__ = 'parents'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable= False)
        children = db.relationship('CHILD', backref= 'parent', lazy=True collection_class=list cascade= 'save_update') # OR all, delete_orphan

    1- collection_class: to decide if you want the collection of children to be set as of type list or dict ...etc
    2- cascade: to select consenquent actions to happen whenever an update or delete occures on parent. Example: delete orphans if a parent is deleted.
    Review: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship

- Referencing a foreign key with a primary key id:
    create table vehicles (
        id integer primary key,
        make varchar not null,
        model varchar not null,
        year integer not null,
        driver_id references drivers(id)
    )
    The above ensures that driver_id will always map to id column in the table drivers. it also ensures driver_id is nonempty.

- using db.foreign_key. Note: db.foreign_key is used in the child table:

    class PARENT(db.Model):
        _tablename__ = 'parents'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable= False)
        ...

    class CHILD(db.Model):
    _tablename__ = 'childs'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable= False)
    parent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('parents.id'), nullable=False)

    Note: parent_id in the CHILD class has same data type of the columns it references in the PARENT class.
    Review: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/constraints.html

- A muture code example to reference a foreign key in table vehicles from parent divers => A driver has many vehicles:

    class Driver(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'drivers'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable= False)
        ...
        vehicles = db.relationship('Vehicle', backref= 'driver', lazy=true)

    class Vehicle(db.Model):
        __tablename__= 'vehicles'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key= True)
        make = db.Column(db.String(), nullable= False)
        ...
        driver_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('drivers.id'), nullable=False)

    Notes: 
        - backref is a custom name referencing what the parent name should be! In our case: vehicles.driver will retreive the parent driver for that vehicle.
        - db.ForeignKey takes a special syntax argument: a string containing 'parent_tablename.parent_primary_key'


Actual Example from our code and steps to do it:
=================================================
- Originally, we have only one model 'Todo' which we store our todo items in. 
- Later we thought that these items needs to be categorized. Therefore, we thought to have a parent model (we called it TodoList) which holds the category of class of todo items. 
- So the relationship will be: one category in TodoList is related to many todo items in Todo model.

Here are the steps that we followed to move from 1 table to parent child tables or models:
    1- Created a parent model:

        class TodoList(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'todolists'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key = True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(), nullable= False)
        todos = db.relationship('Todo', backref= 'list', lazy=True)

    2- Amended the child table configure the relationship with the parent table. So, we add the ForeignKey reference:

        class Todo(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'todos'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key = True)
        description = db.Column(db.String(), nullable= False)
        completed = db.Column(db.Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
        list_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('todolists.id'), nullable=False) 

    3- Execute a migration command:

        $ flask db migrate
        This generated a migration file

    4- run an upgrade command to commit the migrations:

        $ flask db upgrade
        This result in error saying that Todo.list_id is null to the already existing records in the table todos. and becuase it was set to nullable=False, it refuses to the migration.

    5- Two temporary actions made to allow the migration:
        5.1- The generated migration file was amended to allow the migration. list_id was set to nullable=True
        5.2- In model Todo, list_id was configured to nullable=True

    6- run upgrade command it was successful. However, the records in the todos table have their list_id empty which is wrong. Therefore, on db level, the following was done to correct this:
        6.1- a category called 'Uncategorized' was inserted in the parent table:
            todoapp=# insert into todolists (name) values ('Uncategorized');
        6.2- records in the child table were updated to have this category (with id=1) in their list_id:
            todoapp=# update todos set list_id= 1 where list_id is null;

    7- Now, everything in the db looks good. Therefore, we went back to the child model Todo and made the column list_id as nullable=False

    8- run migration once more to detect this change:
        $ flask db migrate

    9- Run upgrade to commit this change in the db:
        $ flask db upgrade

    10- Ensure that this constraint is refelected in the db:
        todoapp=# \d todos
        Note that list_id has not null value in the Nullable column now :)



Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Lists of Todos (Create Lists, Read Lists)
==============================================================================================

- we created a new route in order to show the list of todos filtered by selected todo list:
    @app.route('/lists/<list_id>')

- We set the home view to just redirect to the new route. We put list_id=1 in the home just to make sure a list will show when homepage is accessed. 

- We created more todo items and more list items through python:
    $ python
    >>> from app import db, TodoList, Todo

    - creating list itmes:
        >>> list = TodoList(name='Urgent')

    - creating todo items:
        >>> todo = Todo(description = 'This is really important thing')
        >>> todo2 =  Todo(description = 'Urgent todo 2')
        >>> todo3 =  Todo(description = 'Urgent todo 3')

    - associate these todo items with the list we've just created:
        >>> todo.list = list
        >>> todo2.list = list
        >>> todo3.list = list
    
    - add them into a session: (adding list, will add all its related childs. this is due to the default cascading option in SQLAlchemy)
        db.session.add(list)

    - commit the change:
        db.session.commit()

    - Make sure this is all reflected in the db:
        todoapp=# select * from todolists;
        todoapp=# select * from todos;



Manage many-to-many relationships in SQLAlchemy:
=================================================
Let's assume that we have two tables:
    - Order (parent table)
    - Product (child table)
a product can have 1 or many orders, an order can exist in 1 or many orders. In this case, to remedy this we create an association table (intermediate table):

1- Create an association table:

    order_items = db.Table('order_items',
    db.Column('order_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('order.id'), primary_key=True),
    db.Column('product_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('product.id'), primary_key=True)
    )

    Note: class db.Table is a special class to model the relationship between two many-to-many tables
    association table should link both tables by having their primary_key as ForeignKey in it.


2- Parent table:

    class Order(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False)
    products = db.relationship('Product', secondary=order_items,
    backref=db.backref('orders', lazy=True))

    Note: parent table stores db.relationship, in it we store the secondary table (association table)


3- child table:

    class Product(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False)


Example of adding these association tables in our db:
=======================================================

1- Create their classes in app.py

2- run db.create_all() to make sure these are created in our db (you can import db, and the new classes in a python session and call db.create_all() from there instead of hadcode it in the app.py in case you don't want to)

3- Insert a record in parent table:
    >>> order = Order(status='Ready')

4- Insert a record in the child table:
    >>> product = Product(name= 'Great widget')

5- Associate them:
    Either by calling:
    >>> order.products = [product]

    Or by calling:
    >>> product.orders = [order]

6- Add and commit them:
    >>> db.session.add(order)
    >>> db.session.commit()

Note: if you go on psql and write: select * from order; it will give error because order is a keyword. to fix this:
select * from "order";
