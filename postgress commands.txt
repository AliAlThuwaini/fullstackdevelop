login to postgresql through terminal:
=====================================
1- Method1:
$psql example postgres

2- Method2:
$ sudo -u postgres psql



Create a user in posgres db and make it as superuser for db named 'example'
===========================================================================
1- I already have a user named 'ali' in ubuntu. Therefore, I'll go ahead and create same user in my postgres db env.

2- Login to postgres db as a superuser: 
$ sudo -u postgres psql

3- creat a user called 'ali' with pw '123'
postgres=# CREATE USER ali WITH PASSWORD '123';

4- Give user ali all privileges on db called 'example'
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE example to ali

5- quit: 
postgres=# 

6- Test user ali:
$ psql -d example -U ali

The above worked perfectly for me so far!



Some good commands to know for psql:
=====================================
Once you're in postgres db through terminal you can type the following commands:

\l : list db names in your db env
\c <dbname>: connect to the db with name dbname. If only used \c will inform you which db you're connected to.
\dt: list of table names in the db that you're curreenly connected to.
\d: describes tables schema
\q: quit psql
\?: get help with list of commands in psql





Check if postgres is running:
=============================
Review: https://mydbanotebook.org/post/troubleshooting-01/
>> pgrep -u postgres -fa -- -D

24843 /usr/lib/postgresql/12/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/12/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf

Note: to know the port listening:
1- need to know $PGDATA. This is the part after -D option above: [/var/lib/postgresql/12/main]
2- execute this command:
>> sed -n 4p <$PGDATA>/postmaster.pid
This in my machine translated to:
>> sed -n 4p var/lib/postgresql/12/main/postmaster.pid
You can read the above file only if you're root so:
>> sudo -i
>> cd var/lib/postgresql/12/main/
>> sed -n 4p postmaster.pid
This returned: 5432

- Get your cluster info:
>> pg_lsclusters
this returns:

Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log


- start cluster
>> pg_lsclusters 12 main start



Quicker way to know postgres is running:
>> ls -lA /var/run/postgresql
 This will show the port as well!
